# Comment_BadruddinAslam2014
A repo hosting the data code and figure outputs for a comment on the work of Badruddin &amp; Aslam (2014). An analysis of extremes in the Indian Monsoon in relation to solar activity.

N.b. I have created a Data/ folder which holds the required files for the analysis. However, these are
not necessarily required, as currently the iPtython notebook is set up to fetch the same data from my own 
public server. I note that setting this to fetch to the data on the G-hub repo will not work however. If you 
wish to work without an internet connection, you will therefore need to download the data in Data/ locally,
and link to the local files.
